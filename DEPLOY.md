# Deploying (designer-friendly)

## Option A (easiest): Streamlit Community Cloud
1) Create a GitHub repo and upload this folder.
2) In Streamlit Community Cloud: New app → select repo.
3) Main file: `app.py`
4) Deploy.

If SVG upload fails on cloud: upload PNG/JPG instead (SVG needs extra system libs).
